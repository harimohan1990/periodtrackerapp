      ðŸŒ¸ Understanding Menstruation: A Natural Part of Life<br/>
      Menstruation, or a period, is a normal and healthy part of the reproductive cycle. It happens when the uterus sheds its lining if pregnancy doesnâ€™t occur.<br/><br/>
      Cycles usually last 21â€“35 days, with bleeding for 3â€“7 days. Common symptoms include cramps, mood changes, bloating, and fatigue.<br/><br/>
      Periods are nothing to be ashamed of â€” theyâ€™re a natural sign of health. Tracking your cycle helps you stay in tune with your body and supports overall well-being.
